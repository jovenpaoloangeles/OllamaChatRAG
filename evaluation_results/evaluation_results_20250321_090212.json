          "answer": "<think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out the total amount of new appropriations for the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) in FY 2025 based on the provided context. Let me read through the context carefully.\n\nFirst, I see that there are two tables mentioned. The first table is about the budget for FY 2025, which states that DOST's total appropriations will be p28.77 billion (which is 341.9 million), and this is 1.2% higher than the 2024 budget of p28.43 billion. The main sources are new appropriations at p28.46 billion and automatic appropriations at p315.3 million.\n\nThe second table provides more details about the maintenance and other operating expenses (Mooe), capital outlay (Co), and new appropriations by cost structure for FY 2025. It mentions that new appropriations amount to p28.46 billion, which is a significant portion of the total budget.\n\nSo, putting this together, the total new appropriations are given in both tables. The first table clearly states it's p28.46 billion, while the second table also confirms that part of the total budget comes from new appropriations at p28.46 billion. Therefore, I can confidently say that the total amount of new appropriations for DOST in FY 2025 is p28.46 billion.\n</think>\n\nThe total amount of new appropriations for the Department of Science and Technology (DOST) for FY 2025 is **p28.46 billion**.",
